     * Defines API for a Communicator object.

     * the same machine or accross a network, depending on its implementation.
     * Communicator implements primitive send and receive operations, both synchronous and asynchronous.
     * Data is sent and received as Buffer objects.
     * Important: Communication protocol imposes to: 
     *   - first, send the size of the data as a (serialized) uint32_t
     *   - then, send the actual data
     * Same protocol applies when receiving it.
